# m2bk: A command line tool to simplify MongoDB backups

# This is a configuration file which includes a series of sections
# (which are YAML objects), each one composed by directives
# (YAML numbers, strings or arrays).
# These will determine a corresponding behavior on m2bk.

# This section has directives regarding
# files and directories used
#fs:
#  Full path to the temporary directory
#  in which backups are going to be written
#  output_dir: "/tmp/my_backups"

#
# This section holds directives regarding mongodb servers m2bk
# is going to connect to, including databases that
# are going to be backed up through mongodump.
#
mongodb:
#  Full path to the mongodump executable used by m2bk
#  Default value: mongodump
#  mongodump: "/usr/bin/mongodump"

#  Directory where m2bk is going to temporarily save backup files
#  Default value: /tmp/m2bk

# This is an object/hash, where each element contains a series of
# directives relative to a mongodb database located at a server,
# its specifications and databases themselves held by it,
# these are the main values used by mongodump when it does its magic.
  hosts:
    my_host:
#     mongodb server location
#     Default value: localhost
      address: "localhost"

#     A list of databases who are expected to be inside the mongodb server
      dbs:
        - "test"

#    mongodb server listening port
#    Default value: 27173
#    port: 27173

#    User name used for authentication against the mongodb server
#    Default value: m2bk
#    user_name: "m2bk"

#    Password used for authentication against the mongodb server
#    Default value: pass
#    password: "pass"

# Many directives (such as user name and/or password)
# could be common among the databases that are going to be backed up.
# For this reason, it is best to simply put those common directives
# under a single section, this is entirely optional but also
# it is the best for easily manageable configuration files
# in order to avoid redundancy.
# The supported directives are user_name, password, dbs, auth_db and port.
# See hosts section.
  host_defaults: {}

#
# This section holds all information regarding the
# backup driver to be used by m2bk. A driver is a file
# transfer 'agent' that takes resulting backup files
# and delivers them to some storage (depending on the driver).
#
driver:
  #
  # Name of the driver used by m2bk to deliver backups.
  # Available drivers are: dummy, s3.
  #
  name: s3

  #
  # Driver options:
  # Options vary from driver to driver, in this example, options for
  # the s3 driver are shown. For others, please read the documentation.
  #
  options:

  # Amazon Web Services credentials
  # This sections holds directives regarding AWS credentials
  # that m2bk is going to use in order to upload the mongodump backups to S3.

  # AWS access ID
  # Default value: ''
    aws_id: ""

  # AWS access key
  # Default value: ''
    aws_access_key: ""

  # Name of the main S3 bucket where m2bk is going to upload
  # the compressed backups for each mongodb server specified in mongodb section
  # Default value: m2bk
  #  s3_bucket: "m2bk"
