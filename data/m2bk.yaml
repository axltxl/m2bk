# m2bk: A command line tool to simplify MongoDB backups

# This is a configuration file which includes a series of sections 
# (which are YAML objects), each one composed by directives 
# (YAML numbers, strings or arrays). 
# These will determine a corresponding behavior on m2bk.

# This section has directives regarding
# files and directories used
#fs:
#  Full path to the temporary directory
#  in which backups are going to be written
#  output_dir: "/tmp/my_backups"

#
# This section holds directives regarding mongodb servers m2bk 
# is going to connect to, including databases that 
# are going to be backed up through mongodump.
#
mongodb:
#  Full path to the mongodump executable used by m2bk
#  Default value: mongodump
#  mongodump: "/usr/bin/mongodump"

#  Directory where m2bk is going to temporarily save backup files
#  Default value: /tmp/m2bk

# This is an object/hash, where each element contains a series of 
# directives relative to a mongodb database located at a server,
# its specifications and databases themselves held by it, 
# these are the main values used by mongodump when it does its magic.
  hosts:
    my_host:
#     mongodb server location
#     Default value: localhost
      address: "localhost"

#     A list of databases who are expected to be inside the mongodb server
      dbs:
        - "test"

#    mongodb server listening port
#    Default value: 27173
#    port: 27173

#    User name used for authentication against the mongodb server
#    Default value: m2bk
#    user_name: "m2bk"

#    Password used for authentication against the mongodb server
#    Default value: pass
#    password: "pass"

# Many directives (such as user name and/or password)
# could be common among the databases that are going to be backed up. 
# For this reason, it is best to simply put those common directives 
# under a single section, this is entirely optional but also 
# it is the best for easily manageable configuration files 
# in order to avoid redundancy. 
# The supported directives are user_name, password, dbs, auth_db and port.
# See hosts section.

# Amazon Web Services credentials
# This sections holds directives regarding AWS credentials 
# that m2bk is going to use in order to upload the mongodump backups to S3.
#
aws:
# AWS access ID
# Default value: ''
  aws_id: ""

# AWS access key
# Default value: ''
  aws_access_key: ""

# Name of the main S3 bucket where m2bk is going to upload 
# the compressed backups for each mongodb server specified in mongodb section
# Default value: m2bk
