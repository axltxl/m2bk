#m2bk
###mongodump straight to Amazon S3

*m2bk* is a small DevOps program who performs a number of **mongodb database backups via mongodump**, compresses them into a gzipped tarball and finally sends them to an **AWS S3 bucket**.

##Requirements
* [python](http://python.org) >= 3.3
* [boto](http://docs.pythonboto.org/en/latest/) >= 2.33
* mongodump >= 2.4

You may use *m2bk* under the terms of the MIT License

##Usage

    m2bk [options]

##Options
* `--version` show version number and exit
* `-h | --help` show a help message and exit
* `-c [file] | --config=[file] | --config [file]` specify configuration file to use
* `-d | --dry-run` don't actually do anything
* `-s | --stdout` log messages to stdout too
* `--ll | --log-level=[num]` set logging output level

#Installation
Once the source distribution has been downloaded, installation can be made via **setuptools** or **pip**, whichever you prefer.

	$ # setuptools installation
	$ cd m2bk
	$ python setup.py install
	$ # from this point, you can create your configuration file
	$ cat > /path/to/my/config.conf
	$ {
	$	"aws": {
	$		"aws_id" : "SDF73HSDF3663KSKDJ",
	$		"aws_access_key" : "d577273ff885c3f84dadb8578bb41399"
	$	},
	$	"mongodb": {
	$		"hosts": [
	$			{
	$				"address": "myserver.com",
	$				"user_name": "bob",
	$				"password": "robert",
	$				"dbs" : ['clients', 'seo_stats']
	$			}
	$		]
	$	}
	$ }
	$ # Once installed, you can try it
	$ m2bk -c /path/to/myconfig.conf

If everything went well, you can then check out your S3 bucket to see the backup.

##Configuration file
The configuration is handled through a simple [JSON](http://www.json.org) file including a series of *sections* (which are JSON objects), each one composed by *directives* (JSON numbers, strings and arrays) which determine the behavior on **m2bk**.  If **m2bk** does not receive any configuration file on command line, it will try to read `/etc/m2bk.conf`.
           
The following is an example of what a configuration file looks like:

    $ cat /etc/m2bk.conf
    {
      "debug": true,
      "log": {
      },
      "aws": {
        "aws_id": "SDF73HSDF3663KSKDJ",
        "aws_access_key": "d577273ff885c3f84dadb8578bb41399"
      },
      "mongodb": {
		"mongodump" : "/opt/bin/mongodump",
		"output_dir" : "/opt/tmp/mydir",
		"host_defaults" : {
			"port" : 666,
			"user_name" : "satan",
			"password" : "14mh4x0r",
		},
		"hosts": [
			{
				"port": 34127,
				"dbs": ["app", "sessions", "another_one"]
			},
			{
				"name" : "bar",
				"address" : "bar.example.com",
				"password" : "1AmAn07h3rh4x0r"
			}
		]
      }
    }
Through this configuration file, you can set key variables about the databases you want to backup and the AWS S3 bucket you wish to send them to.
###Configuration file: sections and directives
####Root section
#####Directives
    "debug" : true | false
* Type: **boolean**
* *Default value: false*
* **Role: Debug mode is activated if `true`**

####`log` section
Directives regarding logging output

#####Directives
*FOR THE MOMENT RESERVED*
 
####`mongodb` section
This section holds directives regarding the [**mongodb**](http://mongodb.org) server where **`m2bk`** is going to connect to and also the databases that are going to be backed up through *mongodump*.

***
    "output_dir" : <directory>
* Type: **string**
* *Default value : /tmp/m2bk*
* **Role: directory where m2bk is going to temporarily save the backup files**
* **Examples:** 
>`"output_dir": "/path/to/my/dir"`

***
    "mongodump" : <path_to_executable>
* Type: **string**
* *Default value : "mongodump"*
* **Role: mongodump executable used by m2bk**
* **Examples:** 
>`"mongodump": "/opt/bin/mongodump"`

####`host_defaults` subsection
Many directives (such as the user name and/or password) could be common among the databases that are going to be backed up. For this reason, it is best to simply put those common directives under a single section, this is entirely optional but the best for easily manageable configuration files in order to avoid redundance, the supported directives are `user_name`, `password`, `dbs` and `port` . See **`hosts`** section.

####`hosts` section

This is an array of objects, each containing the following a series of directives relative to a mongodb database located at a server, its specifications and databases themselves contained within it, these are the main values used by `mongodump` when it does its magic. For each entry inside the `hosts` section, these are its valid directives:

#####Directives
***
    "name" : <string> 
* Type: **string**
* Required: YES
* **Role: unique name for the mongodb server configuration**
**NOTE: This value will be used for setting up a S3 bucket subkey inside the main one, it HAS TO BE UNIQUE among its other companion mongodb servers.** 
* **Examples:**
>With a hostname : `"host": "my-hostname"`
>With a FQDN: `"host": "my.host.name"`
>With an IPv4 address: `"host": "192.168.1.1"`

    "address" : <hostname> | <fqdn> | <ip_address>

    "port" : <number>
* Type: **integer**
* Required: NO
* Default value : `host_defaults["port"]` | 27017

***
	"dbs" : <list>

* Required: NO
* Default value : `host_defaults['dbs']` | []
* **Role: a list of databases who are expected inside the mongodb server**
* **Examples:**
>`"dbs": ["jack", "wendy", "danny"]`

**NOTE: particular `dbs` on one host will be merged with those of `host_defaults`**
####`aws` section
This sections holds directives regarding AWS credentials that **`m2bk`** is going to use in order to upload the *mongodump backups* to S3.
#####Directives
***
