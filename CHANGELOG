Version 0.2.0:
------------
+ Upgrade to boto 2.34
+ Each file will be inside its own bucket key (s3_bucket+name)
+ For each mongodump, a random UUID is appended to the
  output directory in order to avoid name collisions
+ One config to rule them all: one config file can handle several
  hosts and their databases
+ Option: Dry run mode -> doesn't do a thing (--dry-run or -d)
+ Option: Log to stdout (-s or --stdout)
+ Option: set log level (--ll or --log-level)
+ 'log' module is now using 'logging' module
* app.init_cmdline is now using argparse instead of the old optparse
* FIX: config._list_merge: dest dict was not being checked out before insertion

Version 0.1.1
------------
+ Include CHANGELOG file
+ mongodump: Host address is included in output file
- app.get_desc was disposed, --version will only show m2s3.__version__
