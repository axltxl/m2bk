------------
+ Option: Dry run mode -> doesn't do a thing (--dry-run or -d)

+ Option: set log level (--ll or --log-level)
+ 'log' module is now using 'logging' module
* app.init_cmdline is now using argparse instead of the old optparse
* FIX: config._list_merge: dest dict was not being checked out before insertion

Version 0.1.1
------------
